### iterable
- the object contains data that can be iterated through
- e:g list, set, string, tuple, dictionary

### iterator
- object (like a pointer) used to iterate over iterable using next() method that return 1 element at a time
- you can generate iterator for the iterable using iter() method
- for loop already call iter() on ther iterable behind the scene
- when there is no next elements it gives StopIteration
- it's almost like c++ iterator but in a python easy way
