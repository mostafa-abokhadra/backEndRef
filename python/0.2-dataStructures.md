### Lists
```
mylist = [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(mylist[:3]) # index 3 not included
print(mylist[::2]) # 2 steps to the end
mylist[0:2] = ['newValOne', newValTwo]
mylist[0:5] = [] # deleting first 5 items
mylist.append("mostafa")
mylist.extend(anoterList) # instead of adding the list "anotherlist" as it is as one element
# in "mylist", extend moves the second list items into the first list creating only one list of both
mylist.remove("mostafa") # remove the first occurance
mylist.sort() # sort works only in an array that contains only numbers or only strings but never both
mylist.sort(reverse=True)
mylist.reverse() # reversing the list
mylist.clear() # remove all items
copy_list = mylist.copy()  # modicfication on copied list don't appear in original list
mylist.count("mostafa") # how many occurance of mostafa
mylist.index("mostafa") # index of mostafa string
mylist.insert(5, "abokhadra") # insert before index
mylist.insert(0, "mostafa") # adding to front
mylist.insert(-1, "beforeEnd")
mylist.pop(5) # remove certain index from the list and returns it
# list is mutable, ,you can reassing ceratin value to a new value

# creating a list with predetermined length
listy = [None] * length
```
### tuples
```
mytuple = ("mostafa", "abokhadra, "21) # or
mytuple = "mostafa", "abokhadra", 21
mytuple[0], mytuple[1], mytuple[3], etc..
# tuple is immutable, you can't reassign certain value to another
mytuple[0] = "newval" # error
# strings and lists methods is available in tuples 
# tuple, list, stirngs repeat usgin *
print(mytuple * 5)
print(mylist * 5)
print(mystr * 5)
# tuple desctruct
var1, var2, var3 = mytuple # tuple should hold tree value
# other wise error will be raised
if you want to ignore certain value in the tuple use underscore
var1, var2, _, var3 = mytuple
```
## difference between lists and tuples

### TUPLE
1. Tuples are immutable
2. The implication of iterations is comparatively Faster
3. A Tuple data type is appropriate for accessing the elements
4. Tuple consumes less memory as compared to the list
5. Tuple does not have many built-in methods.
6. Because tuples don’t change they are far less error-prone.

### Lists
1. Lists are mutable
2. The implication of iterations is Time-consuming
3. The list is better for performing operations, such as insertion and deletion.
4. Lists consume more memory
5. Lists have several built-in methods
6. Unexpected changes and errors are more likely to occur

[!NOTE]
you can think of tuple as a `const list`

### set
```
mySet = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
# items of set must be uinque
# not ordered and not indexed so you can access by mySet[index]
# also you can't slice it [index:endIndex]
# you can only put immutable data in it, so datastructures like dictionary and list can't be held into a set as these are mutable
# it has a lot of the lists methods
myset.union(mySecondSet, thirdset) # or
print(myset | secondSet | etc..)
myset.add(elem)
myset.copy()
myset.remove(5) # remove raise an error if it didn't find the element
myset.discard(5) # don't raise error if didn't find the elem to be removed
myset.pop() # it removes random elem form the set as the elem is not indexed as we say so you can't pass an index to it
myset.update("mostafa", "abokhadra") # it is like union, will just add these 2 strings to myset
myset.update(["1", 2]) # you can pass a list to it as well, as the list itself won't be added to the set but the elements its contain
myset.difference(anotherSet) # or
print(myset - anotherset) 
# it returns all items in myset that don't exist in the anotherSet
myset.intersection(anoterSet) # or
print(myset & anotherset)
# return all items in myset that exists in anotherSet
```
### Dictionary
1. keys should be immutable, so it can't be list for example but can be tuple, strigs or numbers
2. keys must be unique
3. not ordered so can't be indexed by radom access
4. In Python, dictionaries maintain the order of insertion starting from Python 3.7. So, if you use list`(my_dict.keys())[0]`, it will indeed return the first key that was inserted into the dictionary. This means it will give you the "oldest" key based on the insertion order.
```
myDict["keyname"] # or
myDict.get("keyname")
myDict.keys()
myDict.values()
var = myDict.items() # it returns keys and values as tuple
# if you modified myDict and tried to print var it will actually contain the new items as well
myDict["one"]["someKeyInTheNestedDict"]
len(myDict)
myDict.clear()
myDict['age'] = 21
myDict.updata({"country": "Eg"})
myDict.copy()
myDict.setdefault("key": "value")
myDict.popitem() # last elem remove 
keys = ("key1", "key2", "key3")
val = "value"
dict.fromkeys(keys, val) # it will make a dictionary from the iterable "keys" and assign the value of val variable to eack key
```
To detect if any value of a key in a Python dictionary has changed, you can compare the current state of the dictionary with a previous state. Here’s how you can do it:

### Method 1: Using a Hash
```
# You can create a hash or checksum of the dictionary and compare it later to detect any change:
import hashlib
import json

def get_dict_hash(d):
    dict_str = json.dumps(d, sort_keys=True)  # Convert dictionary to a string in a consistent order
    return hashlib.md5(dict_str.encode()).hexdigest()

# Initial dictionary
original_dict = {"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"}

# Store the hash
original_hash = get_dict_hash(original_dict)

# Modify the dictionary
original_dict["key1"] = "new_value"

# Check if the dictionary has changed
if original_hash != get_dict_hash(original_dict):
    print("The dictionary has changed.")
else:
    print("No changes detected.")
```
### Method 2: Comparing Two Dictionaries
If you have two versions of the dictionary (e.g., `old_dict` and `new_dict`), you can directly compare them:

```python
def has_dict_changed(old_dict, new_dict):
    return old_dict != new_dict

# Example usage
old_dict = {"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"}
new_dict = {"key1": "new_value", "key2": "value2"}

if has_dict_changed(old_dict, new_dict):
    print("The dictionary has changed.")
else:
    print("No changes detected.")
```

### Method 3: Monitoring Specific Keys
If you only care about specific keys, you can monitor those directly:

```python
tracked_keys = ["key1", "key2"]

old_dict = {"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"}
new_dict = {"key1": "new_value", "key2": "value2"}

for key in tracked_keys:
    if old_dict.get(key) != new_dict.get(key):
        print(f"The value for '{key}' has changed from {old_dict[key]} to {new_dict[key]}.")
```
