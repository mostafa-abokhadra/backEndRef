## false producing expression:
**any empty dataType, 0 or None compiled to false:**
```
string = ""
bool(string) # false
zero = 0
var = None
listy = []
bool(listy) # flase
dict = {}
tup = ()
```
**all of these above if put in an if condition**
**will be interpreted to false**
## boolean operators
```
and, or, not
```
## logical operators
```
==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
```
## type conversion (casting)
```
str()
dict()
list() 
tuple()
int()
float()
complex()
```
1. when you convert dictionaries to tuple or lists it will make the tuple or list from the keys only
2. when you convert a set to a certain datastructrue a list for
example, it will not be ordered, and if convert a list to a set the set will not be ordered as well 
3. dict(tuple) or dict(list)-> error as dict need key and value pair, so you can only convert 2d tuples or 2d list to dict -> (("key", "value"), ("key", "value"))
or [["one": 1], ["two": 2]], you can't convert a set to dictionary as sets aren't hashable at any cost
