# pyCharm is an IDE for python that you can use like VS

# to run python file -> /bin/python filename.py or python filename.py 
# or ./filename.py # but your file should include #!/usr/bin/python3
# at the first line or better #!/use/bin/env python3

# output
# the only case that you can use semicolon in python is
# when you write multiple commands at the same line
print("hello mostafa ",end=""); print("abokhadra:)") # hello mostafa abokhadra:)
# normally print function add a new line automatically ,
# to disable this we use end=""
