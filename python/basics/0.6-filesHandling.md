### read file
```
file = open("filename.txt ", "r")
print(file.name, file.mode, file.encoding)
file.read() # returns all of the file, but it accept byte number you want to read as well
file.read(10) # only 10 bytes will be read
# the default value is -1 which means read all of the file
file.readline() # reading one line
file.readlines() # return a list of all the lines

for line in file:
    print(line)

file.close()
```
1. open create file if not exists
2. create raise an error if file exists
3. default value if you haven't specified the mode is "read"

### write and append
```
file.write("words") # write method override the file content
lines = ["mostafa\n", "abokhadra\n"]
file.writelines(lines) # it takes list as argument
# to append just open the file in append mode
open("filepath", 'a')
file.tell() # return the position of the cursor in the file (the last character)
# e:g if you have a file contains the string
# "hello" the cursor position will be after the letter 'o' which in the postion 5
# if you add a new line it counts as two character in window not one "\r\n"
# so position will be 7
file.seek(3) # it changes the cursor position in the file in you
# want to write or read starting from another position instead of the end of the file
file.read() # will read starting from position 3
```
