- it is used to iterate over more than one iterable at the same time
- the number of loops will be equal to the smallest iterable length
- it returns a zip object contains all objects
```py
listy = [1, 2, 3]
tuply = (1, 2, 3, 4)
dicty = {"k1": "v1", "k2": "v2", "k3": "v3", "k4": "v4"}
for listItem, tupleIem, dictyKey in zip(lisy, tuply, dicty):
    ...
```

### DocString
```py
def func():
    """this is a docstring
    """
print(func.__doc__) # or
help(func)
```
