# mock
- it mimics a real object behaviour e:g api, database, mailserver
- when we test our code we don't actually want to test the functionality of an external api of a database but of our code
- so we will create a mock object that mimic the behaviour of an api so we can send requests to this mock object and the mock object will return what should the api returns
