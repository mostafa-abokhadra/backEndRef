## Functions
# Dry - don't repeat yourself
```
def functoinName():
    code
```
**What is the difference between parameters and arguments of a procedure?**

- A parameter represents a value that the procedure (function) expects you to pass when you call it. The procedure's declaration defines its parameters.
- Argument: An argument represents the value you pass to a procedure parameter when you call the procedure

### packing and unpacking
```
listy = [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(listy) # [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(*listy) 1, 2, 3, 4

def hello(*people): #in case you don't know how many args you will pass
hello("mostafa", "name2", "name3", "etc..")
# people parameter type is tuple
# so you can pass a tuple instead but unpack it first
tuple = ("msotafa", "mahmoud", "abokhadra")
hello(*tuple)

def hello(**kwargs):
# kwargs type here is dictionary
hello("name1": "mostafa", "name2": "someName", "name3", "etc..")
# if you want to pass a dictionary to the hello func
# you have to unpack it first
dict = {name: "mostafa", name2: "abokhadra"}
hello(**dict)
```
### default parameters
- default value parameter should be at the end of the parameters
```
def func(name, age, country="unknown"):
def func(name="mostafa", age=21)
```
### function scope
```
def func():
    variable = "value" # this var can't be accessed outside the function
    # if you want to make it global declare it like this
    global variable
    # if "variable" already exist in the global scope
    # and you want to apply changes to it do the same
    # thing, say => global variable, variable="newVal"
```
### recursion
```
# postpoone it :)
```
### lambda مجهول
**one single exepression not block of code**
**it has no name**
```
var = lambda param1, param2: f"hello {param1} {param2}"
# the type of var you assign the lambda function to is function
```
