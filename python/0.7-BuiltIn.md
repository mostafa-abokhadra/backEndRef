```
itarbale = [1, 2, 3, 4]
if all(iterable):
    # all element in the iterable should be true in order
    # to get inside the if condition, if even one element
    # is false it will not get in here
```

iterable = [1, 2, 3, 4, []]
if any(iterabel):
    # if any of the iterable element is true it will get in here

```
print(id(variable))
```
### sum()

sum(nums, 5) # 11
``` 
### round()
- it round the number to the nearest interger
```
# round(number, numberOfDigitsAfterDecimalPoint)
round(150.500) # 150
round(150.501) # 151
```
### range()
- accept start, end and step
- start and step is optional
- end is mandatory
