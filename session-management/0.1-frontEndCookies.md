### Updating Cookies via JavaScript

In a browser environment, cookies can be **created**, **updated**, and **deleted** using the `Document.cookie` property. This provides a simple interface to manage cookies on the client side. 

The `Document.cookie` property is used to set and update cookies by assigning a string that defines the cookie's name, value, and additional attributes (like expiration, path, domain, etc.).

#### Syntax:

```javascript
document.cookie = "cookieName=cookieValue; expires=DATE; path=/; domain=DOMAIN; Secure; HttpOnly; SameSite=Lax";
```

### How Updating Works:
To **update a cookie** in JavaScript, you essentially "overwrite" it by setting a new value for an existing cookie. If you specify the same cookie name with a new value, the browser will update the cookie with the new value and the new attributes (if any are provided).

#### Example 1: Basic Update
If a cookie named `user` exists, you can update it with a new value like this:

```javascript
document.cookie = "user=newUsername";
```
This will update the value of the `user` cookie to `newUsername`.

### Full Example:

```javascript
// Set a cookie
document.cookie = "theme=light";

// Update the cookie by setting the same name but different value
document.cookie = "theme=dark";

// Display cookies
console.log(document.cookie);  // Outputs: theme=dark
```

### Important Attributes:

1. **expires**: Defines when the cookie should expire. It must be a string in a specific format (e.g., `expires=Wed, 21 Oct 2025 07:28:00 GMT`).
2. **max-age**: Specifies the lifetime of the cookie in seconds. For example, `max-age=3600` makes the cookie expire in 1 hour.
3. **path**: Defines the URL path the cookie is valid for. For example, `path=/` makes the cookie available site-wide.
4. **domain**: Specifies which domain the cookie is valid for.
5. **secure**: When present, the cookie will only be sent over HTTPS.
6. **HttpOnly**: If this flag is set, the cookie cannot be accessed via JavaScript (useful for security, but cannot be set via JavaScript).
7. **SameSite**: Helps prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) by controlling when cookies are sent with requests originating from different sites.

#### Example 2: Updating a Cookie with Attributes

Let's say we have a cookie for `user_session` that expires in 7 days and is available site-wide. We can update it like this:

```javascript
// Update cookie by setting the same name with a new value and attributes
document.cookie = "user_session=abcd1234; expires=Fri, 31 Dec 2025 12:00:00 UTC; path=/; Secure";
```

- The `expires` attribute sets the expiration date for the cookie.
- The `path=/` ensures that the cookie is available across the entire website.
- The `Secure` attribute makes sure the cookie is only sent over HTTPS.

### Deleting a Cookie

To delete a cookie via JavaScript, you set its `expires` or `max-age` attribute to a date in the past:

```javascript
// Delete the cookie by setting expires to a past date
document.cookie = "user_session=; expires=Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 UTC; path=/;";
```

This will remove the `user_session` cookie from the browser.

### Example Use Cases for Updating Cookies in JavaScript

1. **Remembering User Preferences**:
   If a user updates their site preferences (e.g., changes the site theme from "light" to "dark"), you can store the new value in a cookie:
   
   ```javascript
   // Update the theme preference to "dark"
   document.cookie = "theme=dark; path=/;";
   ```

2. **Extending Session Time**:
   If a user interacts with your application (e.g., by clicking around or performing actions), you might want to extend their session by updating the session cookie:
   
   ```javascript
   let newExpiry = new Date();
   newExpiry.setHours(newExpiry.getHours() + 1);  // Add 1 hour to current time
   
   document.cookie = `session_id=abcd1234; expires=${newExpiry.toUTCString()}; path=/; Secure`;
   ```

3. **Personalized Content**:
   If you personalize content for users (like showing custom ads or recommendations), you can update cookies when users browse different pages, which can track their activity:
   
   ```javascript
   // Track a specific product page visit
   document.cookie = "last_product_viewed=product123; path=/;";
   ```

### Limitations of `Document.cookie`

1. **Size Limits**: Browsers usually limit cookies to around **4KB** in size per cookie. Attempting to set large data as a cookie will fail.
2. **Limited Access to HttpOnly Cookies**: Cookies marked as `HttpOnly` (for security reasons) cannot be accessed via JavaScript to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
3. **Cookie Per Domain Limits**: Browsers also limit the number of cookies that can be stored per domain (usually around 20-50).

### Cookie Store API (Future Alternative)

Though `Document.cookie` is the most widely supported method, newer APIs like the **Cookie Store API** are being developed to provide a more modern, asynchronous approach for working with cookies. While still in development and not yet widely supported, it promises more flexibility and efficiency, including:
- A `Promise`-based API.
- More control over cookie storage and retrieval.

### Summary

Using `Document.cookie`, you can:
- **Create new cookies** by assigning values to `document.cookie`.
- **Update cookies** by setting the same cookie name with a new value and attributes.
- **Delete cookies** by setting their expiration date in the past.

While `Document.cookie` is the most widely supported method for cookie management, be aware of its limitations, and consider the **Cookie Store API** for more advanced use cases in the future.


> [!NOTE]
> Note that, for security purposes, you can't change cookie values by sending an updated Cookie header directly when initiating a request, i.e. via fetch() or XMLHttpRequest. Note that there are also good reasons why you shouldn't allow JavaScript to modify cookies — i.e. set HttpOnly during creation.


### Restriction on Modifying Cookies via `Cookie` Header

When making HTTP requests using JavaScript (via `fetch()` or `XMLHttpRequest`), you **cannot directly modify or send custom cookies** by setting the `Cookie` header. Browsers enforce this restriction for **security reasons**. Specifically, the `Cookie` header is controlled by the browser, and any cookies that are relevant to the request (based on domain, path, and other attributes) will be automatically sent by the browser.

#### Example: Fetch Request without Cookie Header Control

```javascript
fetch('https://example.com/api', {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer token123',  // Custom headers like Authorization are allowed
    'Cookie': 'session_id=abc123'        // This will be ignored, as browsers prevent manual cookie setting
  }
})
```

In the above example, trying to set the `Cookie` header manually will be ignored by the browser. The browser will only send cookies that it has stored and that meet the criteria for inclusion in the request (e.g., same domain, proper `SameSite` rules, etc.).

### Why is this Restriction in Place?

This restriction helps to prevent **cross-site scripting (XSS)** attacks and other security risks where malicious scripts might try to manipulate session cookies or other sensitive data stored in cookies. 

For example:
- **If JavaScript could modify the `Cookie` header directly**, an attacker could inject JavaScript that sends a malicious request with a custom session ID or other security-sensitive cookies, potentially hijacking sessions.
- **Sensitive cookies**, like session tokens or authentication cookies, are often marked as `HttpOnly`, meaning they can't be accessed or modified via JavaScript for security purposes.

### Security Reasons for Using `HttpOnly` Cookies

One of the primary ways to mitigate risks of XSS and cookie manipulation is by marking cookies with the `HttpOnly` flag. Here’s why:

#### What is `HttpOnly`?

- **`HttpOnly`** is a cookie attribute that, when set, **prevents JavaScript from accessing the cookie**. This means cookies marked with `HttpOnly` cannot be read, modified, or deleted using `document.cookie`.
- `HttpOnly` cookies are still sent automatically with each HTTP request to the server but remain inaccessible to JavaScript.

#### Why Use `HttpOnly`?

1. **Prevents XSS Exploits**:
   If an attacker manages to inject malicious JavaScript into a webpage (via an XSS vulnerability), they could potentially steal sensitive cookies like session tokens, login credentials, or authentication tokens. If a cookie is marked `HttpOnly`, it cannot be accessed by JavaScript, reducing the risk of sensitive data theft.

   Without `HttpOnly`:
   ```javascript
   // XSS attack: Malicious script could steal sensitive cookie data
   console.log(document.cookie);  // Outputs session tokens, etc.
   ```

   With `HttpOnly`:
   ```javascript
   // Malicious script can't access the cookie
   console.log(document.cookie);  // Outputs nothing for HttpOnly cookies
   ```

2. **Enhances Authentication Security**:
   Cookies used for sensitive information like authentication tokens or session IDs should always be marked `HttpOnly`. This ensures that they are **only accessible via server-side code** and are not exposed to client-side scripts, protecting them from being compromised.

#### Example: Secure Cookie with `HttpOnly` and `Secure` Flags

```http
Set-Cookie: session_token=abcd1234; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Strict;
```

- **`HttpOnly`**: Prevents JavaScript from accessing the session token.
- **`Secure`**: Ensures that the cookie is only sent over HTTPS, preventing it from being intercepted during transmission.
- **`SameSite=Strict`**: Ensures that the cookie is only sent when requests originate from the same site (helps protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks).

### Summary of Security Considerations

- **You cannot manually set the `Cookie` header** in JavaScript via `fetch()` or `XMLHttpRequest`. The browser controls this behavior to prevent malicious scripts from manipulating sensitive cookies.
- **`HttpOnly` cookies** cannot be accessed or modified by JavaScript, providing extra security for sensitive data, such as session IDs or authentication tokens.
- **Use the `Secure` and `SameSite` attributes** to further protect cookies from being intercepted or misused.

In general, restricting JavaScript’s ability to manipulate cookies and using secure cookie attributes (`HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite`) are key defenses against various types of attacks, including XSS and CSRF.
