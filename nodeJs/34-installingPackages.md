### installing packages
- once you install your first package, a node_modules folder will be created and the package installed will be inside it.
- also package.json file will be updated, dependencies field will be added with the package installed e:g
```json
{
    "dependencies": {
        "packageName": "^packageVersion"
    }
}
```
