### FS module
- it allows you to work with your file system in your pc
- when you require it, it will return fs object
```js
const fs = require("node:fs");
```

### readFileSync()
- read content of a file in synchronous way (js engine will read all of the file content before moving to the next line of the code)
- takes the path to the file you want to read
- it will return a buffer with binary data
- to view it pass a second argument which is the typeOfEncoding

```js
fileContent = fs.readFileSync("./file.txt", "utf-8");
console.log(fileContent)
```

there is another method that allows us to read file contents asynchronously but don't just use it every time, <mark>think about your useCase</mark> sometime it may be better to read files synchronously like if you need the file content before moving on to the next line e:g configuration file that you will be using along the code
