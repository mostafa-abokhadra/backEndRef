- Most letters and characters will simply match themselves. For example, the regular expression test will match the string test exactly. (You can enable a case-insensitive mode that would let this RE match Test or TEST as well)
- There are exceptions to this rule; some characters are special metacharacters, and donâ€™t match themselves. `` ^ $ * + ? { } [ ] \ | ( )``
