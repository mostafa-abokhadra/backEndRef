### API
- every time you visit a page on the Web, you interact with some remote server’s API.
- An API isn’t the same as the remote server rather **it is the part of the server that receives requests and sends responses**.(ROUTES)

**Example scenario:** Your small business’s website has a form used to sign clients up for appointments. You want to give your clients the ability to automatically create a Google calendar event with the details for that appointment.

**API use:** The idea is to have your website’s server talk directly to Google’s server with a request to create an event with the given details. Your server would then receive Google’s response, process it, and send back relevant information to the browser, such as a confirmation message to the user.
