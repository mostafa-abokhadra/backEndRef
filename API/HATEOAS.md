## HATEOAS
HATEOAS stands for Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State and it is a component of RESTful API architecture and design. With the use of HATEOAS, the client-side needs minimal knowledge about how to interact with a server. This is made possible by the network application responding to the clientâ€™s requests with dynamically generated information through the use of hypermedia.
