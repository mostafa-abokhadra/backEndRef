    compound statements

    A compound statement is a block that can contain other blocks; declarations for variables,
    condition handlers, and cursors; and flow control constructs such as loops and conditional tests
    mysql has the following compound statements
    - BEGIN ... END Compound-Statement
    - Statement Label
    - DECLARE
    - Variables in Stored Programs
    - Flow Control Statements
    - Cursors
    - Condition Handling
"""

BEGIN ... END Compound-Statement Syntax
"""
    is used to write compound statements, i.e. when you need more than one statement within stored programs
    e.g. stored procedures, functions, triggers, and events
"""

Declare Statement
"""
    is used to define various items local to a program, for example local variables, conditions and handlers,
    cursors. DECLARE is used only inside a BEGIN ... END compound statement and must be at its start,
    before any other statements. Declarations follow the following order:
    - Cursor declarations must appear before handler declarations.
    - Variable and condition declarations must appear before cursor or handler declarations.
"""

Variables in Stored Programs
"""
    System variables and user-defined variables can be used in stored programs,
    just as they can be used outside stored-program context. Stored programs
    use DECLARE to define local variables, and stored routines (procedures and functions)
    can be declared to take parameters that communicate values between the routine and its caller.
"""

Local variables
"""
    local variables are declared within stored procedures and are only valid within the BEGINâ€¦END block where
    they are declared. Local variables can have any SQL data type

User variables
"""
    variables that you can define and use within your SQL statements.
    They provide a way to store and manipulate values temporarily during the execution of a query
    User variables are prefixed with the @ symbol followed by the variable name.
    They are assigned values using the SET statement or within a query.
    User variables have session scope. This means they persist until the end of
    the session or until they are explicitly unset.

    -In the second example an IN parameter passes a value into a procedure.
    The procedure might modify the value, but the modification is not visible to the caller when the procedure returns.   
    -In the third example, an OUT parameter passes a value from the procedure back to the caller.
    Its initial value is NULL within the procedure, and its value is visible to the caller when the procedure returns.
    -In the fourth example, an INOUT parameter is initialized by the caller, can be modified by the procedure,
