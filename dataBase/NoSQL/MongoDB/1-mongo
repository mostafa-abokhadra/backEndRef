# about NoSQL
# https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-nosql/
"""
    NoSQL is a type of database management system (DBMS) that is designed
    to handle and store large volumes of unstructured and semi-structured data
    Unlike traditional relational databases that use tables with pre-defined
    schemas to store data, NoSQL databases use flexible data models that can
    adapt to changes in data structures and are capable of scaling horizontally 
    to handle growing amounts of data.
    -The term NoSQL originally referred to “non-SQL” or “non-relational” databases,
    but the term has since evolved to mean “not only SQL,” as NoSQL databases have
    expanded to include a wide range of different database architectures and data models.
"""
# Types of NoSQL Databases
"""
    1-Key-value data stores: e:g Memcached, Redis, Coherence
    2-Document stores: store self-describing JSON, XML, and BSON documents.
        They are similar to key-value stores, but in this case, a value is
        a single document that stores all data related to a specific key
        queried using document-oriented query languages.
        e:g MongoDB, CouchDB, Cloudant
    3-Wide-column stores: Wide-column NoSQL databases store data in
        tables with rows and columns similar to RDBMS, but names and
        formats of columns can vary from row to row across the table.
        e:g  Hbase, Big Table, Accumulo, Cassandra
    4- Graph stores: These databases store data as nodes and edges,
         are designed to handle complex relationships between data.
         e:g Amazon Neptune
"""
"""
    NoSQL databases are often used in applications where there is a high volume
    of data that needs to be processed and analyzed in real-time, such as social
    media analytics, e-commerce, and gaming. They can also be used for other applications,
    such as content management systems, document management, and customer relationship management.
"""
# ACID in DBMS
"""
    Atomicity: Atomicity ensures that a transaction is treated as a single, indivisible unit of work.
        Either all the operations within the transaction are completed successfully, or none of them are.
        If any part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction is rolled back to its original state,
        ensuring data consistency and integrity.
    Consistency: Consistency ensures that a transaction takes the database from one consistent state to another
        consistent state. The database is in a consistent state both before and after the transaction is executed.
        Constraints, such as unique keys and foreign keys, must be maintained to ensure data consistency.
    Isolation: Isolation ensures that multiple transactions can execute concurrently without interfering with each other.
        Each transaction must be isolated from other transactions until it is completed. This isolation prevents dirty
        reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads.
    Durability: Durability ensures that once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanent and will survive any
        subsequent system failures. The transaction’s changes are saved to the database permanently, and even if the
        system crashes, the changes remain intact and can be recovered.

# MongoDB
# https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mongodb-tutorial/
"""
    MongoDb is a document-oriented NoSQL database system
    that provides high scalability, flexibility, and performance.
    it stores data in a JSON document structure form.
    -For example, “Take, for instance, a database that holds data
    regarding employees.”. In a relational database, this information
    might be stored in tables, with one table for employee information
    and another table for department information. In a document database,
    each employee would be stored as a separate document, with all of
    their information contained within the document.
    -open-source and cross-platform database System.
    -mongo Database is a container for collections, Each database
    gets its own set of files, A single MongoDB server can has multiple databases.
    -Collection is a group of documents, it is equivalent to RDBMS table, it does not enforce a schema.

# when to use NoSQL
"""
    When a huge amount of data needs to be stored and retrieved.
    The relationship between the data you store is not that important
    The data changes over time and is not structured.
    Support of Constraints and Joins is not required at the database level
    The data is growing continuously and you need to scale the database regularly to handle the data.
