"""
    NoSQL is particularly useful for storing unstructured data,
    which is growing far more rapidly than structured data and
    does not fit the relational schemas of RDBMS. Common types
    of unstructured data include: user and session data;
    chat, messaging, and log data; time series data such as
    IoT and device data; and large objects such as video and images.
"""
# Types of NoSQL Databases
"""
    1-Key-value data stores: # Stored values can be any type of binary object (text, video, JSON document, etc.) 
    2-Document stores: # store self-describing JSON, XML, and BSON documents. They are similar to key-value stores,
                    # but in this case, a value is a single document that stores all data related to a specific key
    3-Wide-column stores: Wide-column NoSQL databases store data in tables with rows and columns similar to RDBMS,
                            but names and formats of columns can vary from row to row across the table.
    4- Graph stores: # A graph database uses graph structures to store, map, and query relationships.
                    # They provide index-free adjacency, so that adjacent elements are linked together
                    # without using an index.
"""
# ACID in DBMS
"""
    Atomicity: Atomicity ensures that a transaction is treated as a single, indivisible unit of work.
        Either all the operations within the transaction are completed successfully, or none of them are.
        If any part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction is rolled back to its original state,
        ensuring data consistency and integrity.
    Consistency: Consistency ensures that a transaction takes the database from one consistent state to another
        consistent state. The database is in a consistent state both before and after the transaction is executed.
        Constraints, such as unique keys and foreign keys, must be maintained to ensure data consistency.
    Isolation: Isolation ensures that multiple transactions can execute concurrently without interfering with each other.
        Each transaction must be isolated from other transactions until it is completed. This isolation prevents dirty
        reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads.
    Durability: Durability ensures that once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanent and will survive any
        subsequent system failures. The transactionâ€™s changes are saved to the database permanently, and even if the
        system crashes, the changes remain intact and can be recovered.
