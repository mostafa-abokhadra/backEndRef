    NoSQL is particularly useful for storing unstructured data,
    which is growing far more rapidly than structured data and
    does not fit the relational schemas of RDBMS. Common types
    of unstructured data include: user and session data;
    chat, messaging, and log data; time series data such as
    IoT and device data; and large objects such as video and images.

# Types of NoSQL Databases
"""
    1-Key-value data stores: # Stored values can be any type of binary object (text, video, JSON document, etc.) 
    2-Document stores: # store self-describing JSON, XML, and BSON documents. They are similar to key-value stores,
                    # but in this case, a value is a single document that stores all data related to a specific key
    3-Wide-column stores: Wide-column NoSQL databases store data in tables with rows and columns similar to RDBMS,
                            but names and formats of columns can vary from row to row across the table.
    4- Graph stores: # A graph database uses graph structures to store, map, and query relationships.
                    # They provide index-free adjacency, so that adjacent elements are linked together
                    # without using an index.
