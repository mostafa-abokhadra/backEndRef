"""
    in MongoDB A Database contains a collection,
    and a collection contains documents and the
    documents contain data, they are related to each other. 
"""
mongo # starts mongo shell
show db
use db_name # create and use db
"""
    in MongoDB, the database is actually created when you
    start entering data in that database, so if you used
    show command after creating the db you will not see the
    new database created
"""
# this will make a new collection and insert an item
db.collection_name.insertOne({...})

# the key value pair
# The field names (keys) are of strings.
# The _id field name is reserved to use as a primary key.
# When you create a collection MongoDB automatically creates a unique index on the _id field.
# The value of the _id field can be set by the user or by the system
# (if the user does not createan _id field, then the system will automatically
#  generate an ObjectId for _id field). 
# A single document may contain duplicate fields.
# The value of the _id field can be of any BSON type except arrays.
# Tip: When you paste data in the functions always use close parenthesis after
# pasting the data into the function. If you use close parenthesis before pasting
# data in the function, then you will get an error.

# to set the id your self add a value to the key insertedId
insertedId: "somevalue"
