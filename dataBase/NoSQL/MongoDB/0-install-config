    Localhost Binding by Default:
        By default, MongoDB launches with bindIp set to 127.0.0.1,
        which binds to the localhost network interface. This means
        that the mongod can only accept connections from clients
        that are running on the same machine. Remote clients will
        not be able to connect to the mongod, and the mongod will
        not be able to initialize a replica set unless this value
        is set to a valid network interface which is accessible
        from the remote clients.

# This value can be configured either:
1-in the MongoDB configuration file with bindIp, or
2-via the command-line argument --bind_ip
