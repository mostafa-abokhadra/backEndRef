"""
    PyMongo, the official MongoDB driver for Python, is indeed
    designed for synchronous operations. This means that when
    you use PyMongo, each operation blocks the execution of your
    code until it completes. However, this doesn't mean that
    MongoDB itself doesn't allow for asynchronous operations.
    
    MongoDB can be accessed asynchronously, but for that, you
    would need to use a different driver or library that supports
    asynchronous code. In Python, you can use `Motor`, which is
    an asynchronous driver built on top of PyMongo and is
    specifically designed to work with asynchronous frameworks
    like `asyncio` or `Tornado`.

    - PyMongo: Synchronous MongoDB operations.
    - Motor: Asynchronous MongoDB operations.

    so If you need to perform non-blocking MongoDB operations in
    an asynchronous Python application, `Motor` would be the
    appropriate choice.
