No idea?
Be creative doesn’t mean “create a web application that will make the world a better place” - no - it means: do what you really want: it can be applying concept your learn during the curriculum - it can be exploring a new technology (VueJS, Angular, Go, Rails, etc.) - or make a clone of an existing platform (I was not joking about the learning platform or video streaming…)

Try to solve a problem or learn!

Also, a web application doesn’t only mean “Website”, it can also be just an API.
