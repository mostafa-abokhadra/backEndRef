### software process

### 1. planning
- gather all the data models and information we need to determine the scope and purpose of the project.
- defining the exact problem
- Conducting interviews
- Sending out surveys
- Determining which resources will be needed
- Pick your project management framework
### 2. Systems analysis and design
- you conduct a feasibility study to ensure that the software systems being created will meet customer requirements and conform to general industry standards.
- If the results of the software requirements analysis are favorable, software teams can then move on to create a detailed software design.
### 3. Development
- Writing code
- Creating the infrastructure for the product
- Documenting everything done along the wayc
### 4. Testing
- this would include automated and human testers
- to use the software for a period of time and make note of any issues to revisit and resolve
### 5. Implementation
- we come to the implementation phase: where the software is prepared for its official release.
- help clients and end-users implement the finished software into their daily workflows. Often, this happens as part of a beta testing phase, where the software is released to a small group of users who provide feedback to the team.
- If problems or errors come up during beta testing, the software returns to the testing phase for further enhancement before being released to the general public.
