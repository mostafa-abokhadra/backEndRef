### A mock
- is a simulated object or module that acts as a stand-in for a real object or module.
- used in testing to isolate the behavior of a particular module or component and to verify that it behaves as expected, without having to rely on the behavior of other parts of the system.

### benefits of using mocks
1. **Improved test reliability**: help to isolate the behavior of individual modules or components, making the tests more reliable and easier to understand.
2. **Faster test execution**: do not have to wait for real objects or modules to respond.
3. **Increased test coverage**: helps to test all possible scenarios and edge cases, improving overall test coverage and helping to catch more bugs and issues.
4. **Reduced test dependencies**: help to reduce the dependencies between tests, making it easier to modify and maintain the test suite over time.
5. **Improved code quality**: 

### unittest.mock
- . It allows you to replace parts of your system under test with mock objects and make assertions about how they have been used.
