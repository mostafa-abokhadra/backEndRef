### testing
-  Code testing refers to running each line of code with a controlled input, and verifying if it performs the expected output. The goal is to identify bugs or errors during the SDLC. While code documentation helps others to understand what you expect your code to do, testing guarantees that it meets these expectations.
- to ensure reliability, stability, and maintainability of software solutions.

### benefits:
1. Ensuring Reliability and Quality
2. less time spent working on hotfixes ðŸ˜‚ðŸ’š
3. Preventing Regression: As applications evolve and new features are added, it's vital to ensure that existing functionality remains intact.
4. Enhancing Maintainability
5. Facilitating Collaboration: among Developers, Quality Assurance (QA) Engineers, and other project stakeholders. Essentially, when you write tests, they serve as a common language that enables you to communicate your intent and ensure that everyone is on the same page. 
6. Building User Confidence
7. Reducing Costs

### types of testing
1. **unit testing**: Unit Testing is the process of testing individual units of code, such as functions or classes.
2. **integeration testing**: Integration Testing refers to a type of Software Testing that focuses on verifying the interactions and communication between different components, modules, or subsystems of a software system, it helps uncover errors such as Incompatible interfaces, Incorrect data transfers, communication failures
3. **End-to-End testing**: End-to-end Testing verifies that your software works correctly from the beginning to the end of a particular user flow. It uses a production-equivalent environment, as well as, data to simulate real-world situations, and may also involve the integrations your software has with external applications.
