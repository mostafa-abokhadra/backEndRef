### testing
-  Code testing refers to running each line of code with a controlled input, and verifying if it performs the expected output. The goal is to identify bugs or errors during the SDLC. While code documentation helps others to understand what you expect your code to do, testing guarantees that it meets these expectations.
- to ensure reliability, stability, and maintainability of software solutions.
