- Caching helps applications perform dramatically faster and cost significantly less at scale
- Cache is a high-speed data storage layer which stores a subset of data, typically transient in nature, so that future requests for that data are served up faster than is possible by accessing the dataâ€™s primary storage location.
- Caching allows you to efficiently reuse previously retrieved or computed data.
- The data in a cache is generally stored in fast access hardware such as RAM (Random-access memory) 
- Trading off capacity for speed, a cache typically stores a subset of data transiently, in contrast to databases whose data is usually complete and durable
