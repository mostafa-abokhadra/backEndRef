### Cach Replacement Policy
- A cache replacement policy refers to the system's method of deciding <mark>which objects or content blocks should be removed from the cache when it becomes full</mark>. Factors such as the size of the object, the time of the last reference, the frequency of requests, the time of last modification, and the cost to fetch the object are all taken into consideration when designing a cache replacement policy. Various strategies, such as randomized, function-based, frequency-based, object size-based, and freshness-based, can be used to determine which objects are removed from the cache.
