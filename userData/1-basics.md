### Personal Data

General Data Protection Regulaion [GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/) defined personal data as any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an <mark>online identifier</mark> or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person;

This definition applies to a person’s name and surname, as well as details that could identify that person. That’s the case when, for instance, you’re able to identify a visitor returning to your website with the help of a cookie or login information.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Under GDPR, you can view cookies as personal data because, according to: Recital 30:
> Natural persons may be associated with online identifiers provided by their devices, applications, tools and protocols, such as internet protocol addresses, cookie identifiers or other identifiers such as radio frequency identification tags. This may leave traces which, in particular when combined with unique identifiers and other information received by the servers, may be used to create profiles of the natural persons and identify them.

The definition of personal data covers various pieces of information, such as:

1. Transaction history
2. IP addresses
3. Browser history
4. Posts on social media
