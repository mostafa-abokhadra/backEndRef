### peronally identifiable information (PII)

-  cover information that could directly or indirectly reveal an individual’s identity.
- including online identifiers like cookies and IP addresses

### National Institute of Standard and Technology

**defined pII** as:

PII is any information about an individual maintained by an agency, including (1) any information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual‘s identity, such as name, social security number, date and place of birth, mother‘s maiden name, or biometric records; and (2) any other information that is linked or linkable to an individual, such as medical, educational, financial, and employment information.

### Importance

But why is all that so important? As a website admin, app creator or product owner, you need to be aware that visitors and users could share sensitive information with you. These traces might enable you to identify individuals, so you must handle such data carefully. From a legal standpoint, it could be a matter of breaches and violations with serious consequences. Grasping the bigger picture is crucial for your organization’s security and legal compliance.

### Types of PII

1. **LInked Information also called direct identifiers**

Direct identifiers are unique to a person and can be used to identify an individual. A single direct identifier is typically enough to determine someone’s identity.

2. **Linkable information**:

concerns indirect identifiers or quasi-identifiers. They may not be able to identify a person on their own, but identification becomes possible when combined with another piece of information. For example, research shows that 87% of US citizens could be identified based on just their gender, ZIP code and date of birth. De-anonymization and re-identification techniques typically work when multiple sets of quasi-identifiers are connected and can be used to distinguish one person from another.

3. sensetive PII:

**Examples**

1. Unique identification numbers, such as driver’s license numbers, social security numbers (SSN), passport numbers and other government-issued ID numbers.
2. Biometric data, such as fingerprints and retinal scans.
3. inancial information, including bank account numbers and credit card numbers.
4. Medical records.
5. Electronic and digital account information, such as email addresses and internet account numbers.
6. Employee personnel records.
7. Password information.
8. School identification numbers.

4. **non sensetive PII:**
- is information that may or may not be unique to an individual person. This type of data can be transmitted without being encrypted, and disclosure of it will not cause harm to the individuals that the data concerns.
- Non-sensitive PII tends to be publicly available
- Some data privacy regulations don’t require the protection of non-sensitive PII, but companies should still employ safeguards to limit the risks to individuals. 

**examples**:

1. A person’s full name.
2. Mother’s maiden name.
3. Social media nickname.
4. Telephone number.
5. IP address.
